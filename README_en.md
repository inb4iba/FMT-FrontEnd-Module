# FMT-FrontEnd-Module
This is a repo created to organize projects/exercises from the first module of the [Floripa Mais Tec](https://floripamaistec.pmf.sc.gov.br/) course.

The course is divided into three modules and onto this part we worked with FrontEnd, using the [Angular](https://angular.io/) framework.

Other modules repositories:
- [**Module 2 - BackEnd**](https://github.com/inb4iba/FMT-BackEnd-Module)
- **Module 3 - FullStack** _(Em breve)_
